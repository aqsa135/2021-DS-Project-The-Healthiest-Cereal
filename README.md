# 2021 Data Science Project: The Healthiest Cereal

## Overview
This project, aims to determine the healthiest cereals using a dataset titled “80 Cereals” from Kaggle. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to identify cereals with the highest nutritional value and the least unhealthy ingredients.

## Data Source
The dataset consists of nutrition facts of 77 different kinds of cereals. It includes 16 columns such as Name, Manufacturer, Type, Calories, Protein, Fat, Sodium, Fiber, Carbohydrates, Sugar, Potassium, Vitamins, Shelf, Weight, Cups, and Rating.

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Converted all entries to factors and handled implausible values.
2. Analysis: Focused on comparing various nutritional aspects of the cereals.
3. Tools: Utilized RStudio for data analysis and visualization.
   
# Key Findings
Identified cereals with the highest and lowest values in categories like calories, protein, fat, sodium, and more.
Analyzed the cereals based on manufacturers and nutritional content.
Concluded that Kellogg's products generally offer a healthier choice, with 'All-Bran with Extra Fiber' standing out as the healthiest option.

## Conclusions
The study highlights the nutritional aspects of various cereals, leading to insights about healthier cereal options. Note that taste, texture, and other personal preferences were not considered in this analysis.

## Future Work
This study can be expanded with updated data and by including other factors like taste and texture to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
